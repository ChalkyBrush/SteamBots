**SteamBot** is a bot written in C# for the purpose of interacting with Steam Chat and Steam Trade.

There are several things you must do in order to get SteamBot working:

## Getting the Source

Retrieving the source code should be done by following the [installation guide] on the wiki. The install guide covers the instructions needed to obtain the source code as well as the instructions for compiling the code.

## Configuring the Bot

See the [configuration guide] on the wiki. This guide covers configuring a basic bot as well as creating a custom user handler.

## Bot Administration

While running the bots you may find it necessary to do some basic operations like shutting down and restarting a bot. The console will take some commands to allow you to do some this. See the [usage guide] for more information.
